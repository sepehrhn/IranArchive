description: |
  Likely gathering point for local solidarity. In the absence of a specific scheduled event, local activists often gather here on Saturdays at 13:00 or 14:00 during peak unrest periods to chant slogans (e.g., 'Woman, Life, Freedom') and show visibility.
  
  **Tips:**
  Since this is not centrally listed online, check the 'Woman Life Freedom Lund' or 'Iranska Studentföreningen i Lund' Facebook/Instagram pages on Friday night for confirmation. If no crowd is visible by 13:15, attendees may have gone to Malmö.
