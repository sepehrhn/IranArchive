title: "Weekly Solidarity Vigil (Recurring)"
featured: false

description: |
  While no 'mega-rally' is scheduled for this specific Saturday, independent activists often hold a standing vigil here every Saturday to support the ongoing uprising. Expect a smaller crowd compared to the massive Feb 7 & Feb 14 events. | Tips: Bring warm clothes (temperatures are freezing). Avoid groups with 'No to Shah, No to Mullahs' banners if you wish to avoid MEK affiliates.
