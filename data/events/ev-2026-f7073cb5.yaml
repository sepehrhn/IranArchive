featured: false

description: |
  Continuation of the weekly mobilization by the Hamburg Iranian diaspora supporting the national uprising. Recent Saturdays (Jan 17, Jan 24) have seen large crowds calling for the fall of the Islamic Republic and supporting opposition figures like Reza Pahlavi.
  
  **Tips:**
  Bring Iranian national flags (Lion and Sun). Be aware that tensions have been high; a vigil was recently attacked by provocateurs, so stay with the main group.
