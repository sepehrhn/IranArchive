description: |
  Large-scale marches often move between Pershing Square and City Hall on Sundays. While the Westwood event is a consistent weekly fixture, larger unified marches frequently occur here during peak uprising periods.
  
  **Tips:**
  Check local 'Woman Life Freedom LA' social channels on Sunday morning to confirm if a specific downtown march is activated for this week. If not, head to Westwood.
