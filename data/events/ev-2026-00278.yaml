title: "Global Day of Action: Solidarity with Iran's Uprising"

featured: true

description: |
  A major international rally designated as a 'Global Day of Action' to support the nationwide uprising in Iran that began in Dec 2025. Protesters are demanding an end to the Islamic Republic, the release of political prisoners detained in the Jan 2026 crackdown, and international recognition of the Iranian people's demand for regime change. Recent rallies have focused on condemning the internet blackout and mass killings.
  
  **Tips:** Wear white or the colors of the Iranian flag (Green/White/Red). Bring warm clothes as it will be cold. Avoid engaging with any counter-protestors. Check 'Woman Life Freedom NYC' or 'New York City for Iran' social media for last-minute time confirmation.
  
  **Location Details:** Broadway & 46th/47th St. Look for 'Woman Life Freedom' signs and the Lion and Sun flags.
