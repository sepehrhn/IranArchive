title: "Global Day of Action: Solidarity with the Iranian Uprising"

featured: true

description: |
  A major rally coinciding with worldwide demonstrations to support the ongoing uprising in Iran. Participants will demand the fall of the Islamic Republic, call for the designation of the IRGC as a terrorist organization, and show solidarity with protesters facing the regime's brutal crackdown. Expect 'Woman, Life, Freedom' chants and pre-1979 'Lion and Sun' flags.
  
  **Tips:** Dress warmly as February in Ottawa is freezing (often -10°C to -20°C). Bring hand warmers. This is part of a coordinated global effort, so turnout is expected to be higher than usual weekly rallies.
  
  **Location Details:** Main lawn in front of the Parliament buildings.
