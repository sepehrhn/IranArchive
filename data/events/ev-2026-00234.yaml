title: "Solidarity Rally for a Democratic Iran"

featured: true

description: |
  A recurring weekly demonstration in solidarity with the popular uprising in Iran. The group advocates for the fall of the Islamic Republic and supports a secular, democratic transition, often expressing support for Prince Reza Pahlavi. Participants typically carry the Lion and Sun flag and chant slogans against the regime.
  
  **Tips:** Dress warmly for sub-zero temperatures. This event is distinct from MEK-organized rallies. It often follows other community gatherings at the same square.
