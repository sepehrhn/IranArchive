title: "Motståndsforum 2026 (Resistance Forum)"

featured: false

description: |
  A day-long forum for various resistance movements. While primarily organized by Palestine solidarity groups, the Swedish-Iranian leftist group 'Arbetarmakt' is mobilizing attendance to discuss the Iranian uprising and build solidarity between movements.
  
  **Tips:**
  Indoor event. Note that this is a broader 'anti-imperialist' forum, not exclusively an Iran protest. Suitable if you are interested in leftist coalition building.
