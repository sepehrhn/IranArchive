title: "Irvine Solidarity Gathering for Iran Uprising"

featured: false

description: |
  Weekly standing rally in solidarity with the nationwide uprising in Iran and against the recent crackdown (estimates of 3,000+ dead). Protesters typically carry Lion and Sun flags and placards condemning the regime's violence.
  
  **Tips:**
  This location is a shared protest hub. A separate protest against ICE/Federal Agents has been using the 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM slot recently. The Iranian community gathering often starts later (around 2:00 PM) or occupies a distinct corner. Look for the Iranian flags to join the correct group.
