  While Sundays are traditionally used by the Iranian diaspora for rallies at Trocadéro or Bastille, no specific 'Iran' flyer has been confirmed for this Sunday (Feb 1). Note that a large protest supporting the DRC (Congo) is planned for Bastille on this day, so the square will be busy with a different cause.
  
  **Tips:**
  Check 'Femme Vie Liberté Paris' social channels on Saturday night for any last-minute Sunday impromptu gatherings, but the main energy is focused on Saturday's République event.
