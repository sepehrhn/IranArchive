title: "Protest for Kurdish Political Prisoners & Iran Solidarity"

featured: false

description: |
  February 15 marks the anniversary of the capture of Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan. Given the prominent role of Kurdish regions in the current Iran uprising (and the 'Woman, Life, Freedom' slogan's Kurdish origins), this protest will likely have a strong focus on solidarity with the crackdown in Iranian Kurdistan (Rojhilat).
  
  **Tips:** Expect a mix of Kurdish flags and Iran solidarity signs. This is often a passionate and loud demonstration.
  
  **Location Details:** Archibald Fountain area.
