featured: false

description: |
  Smaller, often spontaneous or student-led gatherings frequently occur on Saturdays at Union Square to raise awareness among tourists and locals about the mass killings and internet blackouts in Iran. | Tips: This event is less formally structured than the Sunday rally. Look for the group with flags near the center of the square.
