title: "Weekly Solidarity Rally (Tentative)"

featured: true

description: |
  Weekly rallies have been held here on Sundays throughout the uprising by grassroots groups (often distinct from the Pahlavi-aligned group). While the Saturday event is the main focus this weekend, a gathering here is likely for those maintaining the weekly vigil tradition.
  
  **Tips:** Check 'Solidarity with Iranians' or 'Woman Life Freedom Vancouver' social media for last-minute confirmation, as the Saturday event may supersede this one.
  
  **Location Details:** South Plaza (Robson Street side) is the standard meeting point.
