featured: false

description: |
  Part of the worldwide action week (Jan 25 – Feb 1) defending the women's revolution. While focused on Rojava, this event is explicitly linked to the 'Jin Jiyan Azadi' (Woman, Life, Freedom) movement and solidarity with the uprising in Iran against the Islamist regime.
  
  **Tips:**
  This is a global call to action. Expect a strong focus on women's rights and cross-movement solidarity. Look for purple flags and 'Jin Jiyan Azadi' banners.
