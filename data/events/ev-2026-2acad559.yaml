  A rally to support the ongoing uprising in Iran and condemn the regime's brutal crackdown (including the recent massacres and internet blackouts). Participants demand regime change and show solidarity with the 'Woman, Life, Freedom' movement.
  
  **Tips:**
  Parking is available in the nearby Galleria garages. Attendees often bring Iranian flags (Lion and Sun) and signs. Be prepared for a high-traffic area; police often monitor the corners for safety.
