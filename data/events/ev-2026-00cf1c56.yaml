  While the main weekly rally is Saturday, a large gathering was held here last Sunday (Jan 25). No official announcement has been confirmed for Feb 1, but community members sometimes gather here on Sundays.
  
  **Tips:**
  Treat this as unconfirmed. If you go, look for groups near the Olympic Cauldron. Priority should be given to the Saturday event.
