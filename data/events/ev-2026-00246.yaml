title: "Satellite Solidarity Gathering"

featured: false

description: |
  Smaller, often youth-led gatherings sometimes occur on Saturdays if the main Sunday rally is at the Art Gallery. Focuses on raising awareness for political prisoners and recent execution orders.
  
  **Tips:** Saturday afternoons at the Art Gallery are often occupied by other causes (e.g., Palestine solidarity), so Iran-specific events may move to Jack Poole Plaza or occur on Sunday instead.
  
  **Location Details:** 1055 Canada Pl; near the Olympic Cauldron.
