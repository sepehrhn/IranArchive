title: "Global Day of Action: Solidarity with Iran's Uprising"

featured: true

description: |
  A mass rally in solidarity with the January 2026 uprising in Iran. This event answers the global call for a coordinated day of protest to condemn the regime's recent mass killings and crackdowns. Protesters will demand the immediate release of political prisoners and an end to the Islamic Republic.
  
  **Tips:** Dress warmly as it is an outdoor standing event. Bring Iranian flags (Lion and Sun preferred by this coalition) and signs. Check @Chicago4Iran on Instagram for last-minute updates.
  
  **Location Details:** Corner of Adams & Dearborn Streets; accessible via Monroe or Jackson CTA Blue/Red lines.
