title: "Global Day of Action: Solidarity with the Iranian Uprising"

featured: true

description: |
  A major solidarity rally coinciding with protests in dozens of cities worldwide. Demonstrators will be gathering to condemn the brutal crackdown by the Islamic Republic (including the recent mass killings in January) and to support the Iranian people's demand for regime change and democracy. Expect speeches, chanting of slogans like 'Woman, Life, Freedom', and a call for international sanctions.
  
  **Tips:** Malieveld is a short walk from Den Haag Centraal. Dress warmly for February weather. Many attendees will be carrying the pre-revolutionary 'Lion and Sun' flag; avoid bringing symbols not aligned with the general unity of the uprising.
  
  **Location Details:** Large grass field near Den Haag Centraal station; look for the Lion and Sun flags.
