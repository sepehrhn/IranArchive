description: |
  While officially the 'Brigit Parade' celebrating women, Iranian solidarity groups have historically used St. Brigid's Day events to highlight the 'Woman, Life, Freedom' movement. An Iranian solidarity bloc is highly likely to participate given the strong thematic alignment with the festival.
  
  **Tips:**
  This is a moving parade rather than a static protest. Arrive early to locate the solidarity bloc. The theme is 'Celebrating Women', making 'Woman, Life, Freedom' banners highly relevant.
