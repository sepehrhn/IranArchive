description: |
  A major weekly solidarity rally, expected to be particularly large this Sunday ahead of the '22 Bahman' anniversary. Protesters will demand the fall of the Islamic Republic, condemn the January 2026 massacres (estimates of 5,000+ dead), and call for the expulsion of regime diplomats. Expect chants of 'Death to the Dictator' and support for the 'Woman, Life, Freedom' movement.
  
  **Tips:** Parking in Westwood is extremely difficult; consider parking at nearby UCLA lots or using rideshare. Wear comfortable shoes for standing. Avoid engaging with any pro-regime provocateurs if they appear.
