title: "Weekly Solidarity Gathering (Recurring)"

featured: false

description: |
  While the massive major rally occurred on Jan 25, smaller weekly solidarity gatherings are highly likely to continue on Sundays to maintain pressure on the EU Parliament and Commission. Expect slogans supporting the uprising and condemning the execution of protesters.
  
  **Tips:**
  Check 'Woman Life Freedom Brussels' or 'Free Iran Belgium' (non-MEK) social media for last-minute confirmation. Bring warm clothes and rain gear as Brussels weather is unpredictable in February.
