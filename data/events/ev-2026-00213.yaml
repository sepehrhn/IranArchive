title: "Weekly Vigil / Mahnwache (Unconfirmed)"

featured: false

description: |
  While no major specific call has been issued due to the Berlin mobilization, local grassroots groups often hold standing vigils on Saturdays to support political prisoners and the uprising. This is a non-MEK, community-led gathering point.
  
  **Tips:** Since many activists are travelling to Berlin, this local attendance may be smaller. Check Instagram channels like @womanlifefreedom_frankfurt or @iran_protest_frankfurt for last-minute cancellations.
  
  **Location Details:** Common meeting point for 'Woman Life Freedom' rallies; check local social media for last-minute confirmation.
