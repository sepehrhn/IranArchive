featured: false

description: |
  Large-scale demonstration supporting the revolution in Iran. Previous rallies in Jan 2026 have drawn thousands (estimated 4,000+ on Jan 18). This is the primary event for Southern California if local Irvine events are quiet.
  
  **Tips:**
  Expect road closures downtown. Many Irvine residents carpool to this larger event for maximum visibility.
