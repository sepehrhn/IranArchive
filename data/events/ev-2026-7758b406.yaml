description: |
  While no specific flyer is confirmed for Sat Jan 31, this group held a major rally on Jan 21 demanding 'Regime Change' and 'Death to Khamenei'. They are the most active non-MEK group currently. Check their social media for impromptu weekend gatherings.
  
  **Tips:**
  Verify on student group social media before heading out. Avoid City Hall unless an Iran-specific event is explicitly announced there, due to the concurrent anti-ICE protests.
