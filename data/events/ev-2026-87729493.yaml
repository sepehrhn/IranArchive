description: |
  Weekly silent vigil. WARNING: This is primarily a Palestine solidarity event ('against the occupation'), NOT the Iran protest. Listed here so you do not confuse the two if you see a silent line of people in black.
  
  **Tips:**
  If you are looking for the Iran protest, this is likely not it, though some intersectional solidarity may exist.
