  A major solidarity rally supporting the January 2026 uprising in Iran. Participants will demand an end to the regime's brutal crackdown, mass killings, and internet blackouts. The event aims to be the 'voice of the voiceless' amid the communication blockade.
  
  **Tips:**
  Large crowds expected (previous rallies drew tens of thousands). Dress for cold weather. The location was formerly known as Yonge-Dundas Square.
