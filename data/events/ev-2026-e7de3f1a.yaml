description: |
  A massive human chain along the Golden Gate Bridge sidewalk to show solidarity with the nationwide uprising in Iran and honor the estimated 3,000+ victims of the recent regime crackdown. Visuals often include red symbols or performance art representing the massacre.
  
  **Tips:**
  The official bridge calendar and community hotlines list this for Saturday, Jan 31, despite some local news reports mentioning Sunday. Arrive early (11am) to find parking or take public transit/shuttles, as the bridge plaza gets very crowded. Dress warmly for wind.
