description: |
  A major demonstration calling for the defense of Rojava and solidarity with the uprising in Iran. The event links the 'Jin, Jiyan, Azadî' (Woman, Life, Freedom) movement across borders, protesting the brutal crackdowns by both the Iranian regime and regional aggressors. Expect a large presence of feminist and leftist organizations.
  
  **Tips:**
  Note that a separate demonstration for Palestine is planned at the same location (République) earlier at 14:00. The Iran/Rojava specific gathering is scheduled for 17:00, though crowds may merge.
