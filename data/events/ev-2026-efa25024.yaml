description: |
  A major mass mobilization to form a human chain across the Golden Gate Bridge in solidarity with the January 2026 uprising in Iran. Participants are asked to stand shoulder-to-shoulder to echo the voices of protesters in Iran. Expect a large turnout (estimates 5,000+).
  
  **Tips:**
  Arrive by 11:00 AM for assembly; the chain usually forms by 12:00 PM. Dress warmly (windy). Use public transit or rideshare as parking will be extremely limited. Bring Iranian flags (Sun & Lion or plain tricolor) and protest signs.
