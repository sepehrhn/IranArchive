  While no official flyer has been released for this specific date, the Texas State Capitol is the standard meeting point for Iranian diaspora gatherings in Austin. Small, spontaneous groups may gather here on Saturday afternoons (typically 12:00 PM - 3:00 PM) given the severity of the ongoing crackdown in Iran.
