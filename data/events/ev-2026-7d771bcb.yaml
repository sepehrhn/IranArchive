description: |
  Recurring weekly gathering to protest the Islamic Republic. Note: While often attended by general community members, Sunday rallies at this location can sometimes attract MEK/NCRI supporters. Look for 'Woman Life Freedom' signs to find grassroots groups.
  
  **Tips:**
  This is a likely recurring event based on patterns from previous weeks, though the Saturday Bridge event is the primary focus this weekend.
