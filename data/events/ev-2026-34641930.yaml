  The Federal Building is a traditional protest site for the LA Iranian community. This weekly rally has grown significantly during the Jan 2026 uprising. Protesters wave Lion and Sun flags and demand international action against the regime's crackdown.
  
  **Tips:**
  Police presence is heavy due to the vehicle attack at this location earlier in January. Stay on the sidewalks and follow crowd marshals' instructions. Bring water.
