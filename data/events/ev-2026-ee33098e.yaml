description: |
  A major weekly demonstration in solidarity with the ongoing uprising in Iran, condemning the recent brutal crackdown and mass killings. Participants typically chant 'Woman, Life, Freedom' and anti-regime slogans. Recent rallies have been large (1,000+ people) and included speeches and marches towards Oxford Road or Piccadilly Gardens.
  
  **Tips:**
  Dress warmly for winter weather. Be aware that the crowd may include diverse political factions (Monarchist and Leftist blocs often stand separately). Police presence is likely due to the size of the crowd.
