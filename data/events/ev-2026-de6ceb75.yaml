description: |
  A gathering to demand the expulsion of Iranian diplomats and condemn the recent mass killings (estimated 3,000+ dead) and internet blackouts imposed by the regime. Expect chanting in Farsi and English ('Woman, Life, Freedom'), speeches, and placards.
  
  **Tips:**
  The 'Brigit 2026' festival is running this weekend with events/projections at the GPO. The protest is likely to remain at the Spire but may move slightly to avoid festival infrastructure. Look for the Iranian 'Lion and Sun' flags.
