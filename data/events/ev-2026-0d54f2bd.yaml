  Recurring Sunday rally where the diaspora gathers to chant anti-regime slogans ('Death to the Dictator'), sing revolutionary songs, and demand international action against the Islamic Republic. This event has been happening for 'several Sundays' consecutive to the uprising.
  
  **Tips:**
  This is a standing rally often featuring open mic speeches and chanting. It is a central meeting point for the community if you miss the specific Saturday event.
