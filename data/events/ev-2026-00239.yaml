title: "Global Day of Action: Solidarity with the Iranian Revolution"

featured: true

description: |
  A major rally coinciding with the 'Global Day of Action' called by opposition figures including Reza Pahlavi. The protest brings together a coalition of Iranian ethnic minority groups (Ahwazi, Kurdish, Baluchi, etc.) and constitutionalist supporters to demand the designation of the IRGC as a terrorist organization and to support the ongoing uprising in Iran.
  
  **Tips:** Expect a large crowd as this is part of a worldwide coordinated effort. Security will be tight around EU institutions. Bring warm clothes and rain gear as Feb weather is unpredictable.
  
  **Location Details:** Metro Schuman. The square in front of the European Commission/EEAS buildings.
