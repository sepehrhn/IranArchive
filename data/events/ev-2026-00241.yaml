title: "Weekly Solidarity Rally with Iran Uprising"

featured: true

description: |
  A major weekly gathering to support the ongoing nationwide uprising in Iran (sparked in Dec 2025). Given the concurrent visit of the Israeli President and expected pro-regime slogans from other protest groups nearby, this rally will focus on distinguishing the Iranian people's fight for freedom from the Regime's foreign policy. Expect chants of 'Woman, Life, Freedom' and calls for Western intervention/support.
  
  **Tips:** This location may be crowded due to overlapping protests regarding President Herzog's visit. Look for the 'Lion and Sun' (pre-1979) flags to identify the anti-regime Iranian crowd. Avoid groups waving yellow Hezbollah flags.
  
  **Location Details:** 483 George St, Sydney NSW 2000 (likely on the steps or adjacent square)
