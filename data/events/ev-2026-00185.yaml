title: "Toronto Stands with Iran's Revolution"

featured: false

description: |
  A major solidarity rally supporting the nationwide uprising in Iran that began in late December 2025. Demonstrators are demanding an end to the Islamic Republic, condemning the recent brutal crackdown and mass killings (estimated at 3,000+), and calling for international support. Participants often carry the pre-revolutionary 'Lion and Sun' flag and may express support for opposition figures like Reza Pahlavi.
  
  **Tips:** Dress extremely warmly as 'Arctic' weather conditions are forecast for Toronto this weekend. Expect a large crowd; protesters often march, so wear comfortable boots.
  
  **Location Details:** Southeast corner of Yonge St & Dundas St; nearest subway is Dundas Station.
