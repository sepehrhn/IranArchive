title: "Community Gathering & Information"

featured: false

description: |
  While primarily a cultural cottage, the House of Iran serves as a central hub for the diaspora on weekends. During times of unrest, it often becomes a gathering point for sharing information and informal solidarity, though specific organized marches often start here and move to the Art Museum.
  
  **Tips:**
  A good location to connect with the local community for updates on impromptu actions. Parking in Balboa Park can be difficult on Sundays; arrive early.
