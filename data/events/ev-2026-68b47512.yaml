title: "Weekly Rally for a Free Iran"

featured: false

description: |
  A major weekly demonstration in solidarity with the nationwide uprising in Iran. Participants will demand an end to the Islamic Republic's crackdown, which has intensified in late January 2026. Expect speeches from activists, chanting of slogans (e.g., 'Woman, Life, Freedom'), and a march through downtown streets.
  
  **Tips:**
  This is the primary weekly gathering. Avoid any smaller groups wearing yellow vests or carrying portraits of Maryam/Massoud Rajavi if you wish to avoid MEK/PMOI affiliations; the main crowd gathers under the 'Woman Life Freedom' banner and the Lion and Sun flag.
