title: "Sunday Solidarity Gathering (Likely)"

featured: true

description: |
  Weekly grassroots gatherings often occur here on Sundays to support the uprising. Unlike the organized political rallies at City Hall, these tend to be more community-focused and independent.
  
  **Tips:** Check social media (Instagram/Telegram) for 'Woman Life Freedom DFW' to confirm. Wear comfortable shoes and bring water.
  
  **Location Details:** 2012 Woodall Rodgers Fwy, Dallas, TX 75201. Look for the 'Woman, Life, Freedom' banners near the main lawn or food trucks.
