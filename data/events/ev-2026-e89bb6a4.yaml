  While primarily a National Demonstration for Palestine, this date is also a 'Global Action Day' for 'Women Defend Rojava'. Expect a 'Woman, Life, Freedom' bloc or contingent showing solidarity with the uprising in Iran, specifically connecting the struggles of women in the region against religious authoritarianism.
  
  **Tips:**
  This will be a very large crowd. Look for the 'Jin, Jiyan, Azadî' banners or Kurdish/Iranian solidarity flags (Lion & Sun) within the main assembly to find the relevant contingent.
