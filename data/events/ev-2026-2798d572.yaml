description: |
  Weekly gathering in solidarity with the ongoing uprising in Iran. Demonstrators demand regime change, the release of political prisoners, and an end to the crackdown. This location has been the central hub for LA's Iranian diaspora protests every Sunday since the uprising began.
  
  **Tips:**
  Parking is difficult; avoid Veteran Ave due to road closures/crowds. Use public transit or park in nearby residential areas south of Wilshire (read signs carefully). Be aware that MEK supporters sometimes attend these open rallies; they often wear yellow vests or carry photos of Maryam/Massoud Rajavi. The main crowd supports the diverse 'Woman, Life, Freedom' movement.
