  Potential spontaneous gathering in solidarity with the January 2026 uprising. No official announcement found, but this is the standard location for local protests.
  
  **Tips:**
  If no crowd is present by 14:00, consider traveling to Malmö (Möllevångstorget or Gustav Adolfs Torg) where larger demonstrations are more frequent.
