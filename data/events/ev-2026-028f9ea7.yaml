  While the main focus is the D.C. vigil on Sunday, local activists often gather at Washington Square Park (the site of the Jan 19 rally) on Saturdays to maintain visibility. Expect a smaller, community-focused gathering if not traveling.

  Check the Instagram page @womanlifefreedomnyc for last-minute confirmation. If no official event is posted, this remains a common impromptu meeting point.
