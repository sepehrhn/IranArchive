featured: false

description: |
  A recurring weekly solidarity rally supporting the uprising in Iran. Participants gather to condemn the regime's recent crackdown and executions, chanting slogans like 'Jin, Jiyan, Azadi' (Woman, Life, Freedom). Speeches are usually in German and Persian. | Tips: Dress warmly. Bring a candle or flashlight as these events often transition into vigils as dusk falls. Look for the Lion and Sun flags (without MEK branding) or 'Woman Life Freedom' banners.
