title: "Emergency Contingency Protest (Conditional)"

featured: false

description: |
  A standing plan exists for an emergency protest at 5:00 PM on the day of (or day after) any U.S. military strike on Iran. Given the current high tensions (US carrier strike group arrival, live-fire drills in Hormuz), this location is the likely hub for any emergency mobilization.
  
  **Tips:** This is a CONDITIONAL event. Confirmed only if military escalation occurs or spontaneous crowds gather.
  
  **Location Details:** Standard meeting point for emergency anti-war protests.
