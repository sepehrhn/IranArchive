title: "Weekly Rally: Stop the Massacres & Solidarity with Iran Uprising"

featured: true

description: |
  Weekly protest calling for an end to the brutal crackdown, mass killings, and executions in Iran. Demands include the expulsion of Islamic Republic ambassadors and international support for the Iranian people's revolution.
  
  **Tips:** Police presence in the CBD is high due to concurrent protests (e.g., Palestine/Anti-Herzog rally at Hyde Park). Town Hall is a 'restricted' protest area but this event has proceeded peacefully in previous weeks. Bring water and sun protection.
  
  **Location Details:** Steps of Town Hall; likely meeting point for speeches before any potential march.
