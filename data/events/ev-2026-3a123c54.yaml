title: "Solidarity with the Iran Uprising"

featured: false

description: |
  A gathering to condemn the recent massacres (estimated 12,000+ dead) and internet blackout in Iran. This location is typically used by the diverse, non-MEK diaspora community. Expect chants of 'Woman, Life, Freedom' and calls for international action.
  
  **Tips:**
  Dress warmly (forecast is sub-zero). This is the most likely location for the general, non-sectarian opposition.
