description: |
  An informal but continuous presence to maintain pressure on the US administration. Activists often gather here on Saturdays to display images of recent victims and engage with tourists/public.
  
  **Tips:**
  This is often a smaller, more fluid gathering compared to the Sunday rally. Police presence may be high due to proximity to the White House.
