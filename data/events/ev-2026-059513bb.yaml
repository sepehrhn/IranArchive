description: |
  A major rally to show solidarity with the ongoing 2026 uprising in Iran. Demonstrators will gather to condemn the brutal crackdown, mass executions, and internet blackouts imposed by the Islamic Republic. The event aims to amplify the voices of protesters in Iran who are currently silenced by the regime's communications blockade.
  
  **Tips:**
  Dress warmly for outdoor standing. Bring 'Woman, Life, Freedom' signs or the Lion and Sun flag. Note that Yonge-Dundas Square has been renamed Sankofa Square, but most locals still know it by the old name. Expect large crowds and potential road closures on Yonge Street.
