title: "Standing Vigil for Iran (Likely)"

featured: true

description: |
  While no massive march is scheduled for this specific Sunday, Lafayette Square is the traditional standing location for Iranian diaspora vigils. Expect smaller groups gathering to chant slogans like 'Woman, Life, Freedom' and engage with tourists/locals, especially given the recent UN emergency session.
  
  **Tips:** This is likely an informal gathering rather than a permitted stage rally. Bring Iranian flags (Sun & Lion) and signs. Check 'Woman Life Freedom DC' social channels for last-minute meetups.
  
  **Location Details:** H St NW & 16th St NW; Nearest Metro: McPherson Sq or Farragut West
