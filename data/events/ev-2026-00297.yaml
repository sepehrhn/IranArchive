title: "Global Day of Action: Solidarity with the Lion and Sun Revolution"

featured: false

description: |
  A major solidarity rally designated as a 'Global Day of Action' to support the uprising in Iran. Demands include the expulsion of regime diplomats and support for a democratic transition. This follows the massive Feb 1 rally and responds to the regime's recent crackdown.
  
  **Tips:** Dress warmly for -10°C to -15°C weather. Bring 'Lion and Sun' flags (no Islamic Republic symbols). Public transit (TTC buses to Steeles) is recommended as traffic will be heavy.
  
  **Location Details:** Intersection of Yonge and Steeles; a common gathering point for the Iranian community in North York. Look for the 'Lion and Sun' flags.
