title: "DC Support Rally for the National Uprising"

featured: false

description: |
  A major rally to echo the voices of compatriots inside Iran and condemn the brutal crackdown (referenced as 'Iran's Babi Yar' in recent reports). The event supports the national uprising and explicitly recognizes Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi as the leader for the transition, calling for complete regime change. The program includes guest speakers, videos, and chants followed by a march.
  
  **Tips:** Wear warm clothing as February in DC is cold. Bring 'Lion and Sun' flags (the pre-1979 flag) if you have them, as these are the primary symbol of this movement. Be cautious of potential pro-regime agitators, though security is usually present.
  
  **Location Details:** 2 Lincoln Memorial Cir NW; gathering likely on the steps or plaza facing the Reflecting Pool.
