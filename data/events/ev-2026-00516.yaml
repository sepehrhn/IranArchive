featured: false

description: |
  A focused gathering outside the regime's embassy to condemn the recent mass killings (estimated 3,000+) and detention of protesters. Participants often display photos of recent martyrs and chant for the closure of the embassy. | Tips: These embassy protests are often smaller but more intense than the Schuman rallies. Police often cordon off the immediate front of the embassy.
