featured: false

description: |
  A major weekly gathering to support the ongoing uprising (began Dec 2025) and condemn the regime's brutal crackdown. Protesters are demanding regime change and an end to the '2026 Massacres.' Expect chants of 'Woman, Life, Freedom' and calls for international action. | Tips: This is the primary gathering point. Parking in Westwood is very difficult; consider parking at the Hammer Museum or using rideshare. Be aware that this location was the site of a vehicle attack on Jan 11; while security is now heightened, remain vigilant near the street.
