title: "Global Day of Action: Solidarity with the Lion and Sun Revolution"

featured: false

description: |
  A major rally marking the 'Global Day of Action' called by Reza Pahlavi and the Transitional Leadership of Iran. Demonstrators will gather to support the nationwide uprising in Iran, condemn the January massacres, and demand the designation of the IRGC as a terrorist organization. Expect 'Lion and Sun' flags and slogans calling for regime change.
  
  **Tips:** This is expected to be a large gathering. Wear comfortable shoes as rallies at the Washington Monument often involve marching to the White House (approx. 15-20 min walk). Dress warmly for February weather. Avoid engaging with any pro-regime agitators.
  
  **Location Details:** Independence Ave SW & 15th St NW; closest Metro: Smithsonian (Blue/Orange/Silver)
