external_id: "110daec8-841c-40d4-a5af-59896ba11427"

description: |
  Spontaneous and ongoing gatherings have been reported here throughout January. Given the severity of the recent crackdown (30,000+ estimated dead), independent protesters often gather here on weekends to chant slogans and display images of victims.
  
  **Tips:**
  Police presence is currently high due to recent incidents of protesters scaling the balcony. Bring warm clothes and prepared slogans/placards. Avoid MEK-affiliated groups if they attempt to co-opt the space.
