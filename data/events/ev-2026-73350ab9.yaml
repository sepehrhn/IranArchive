  While primarily a cultural cottage open to the public on Sundays, the House of Iran in Balboa Park serves as a central hub for the community during times of crisis. Given the severity of the current crackdown (Jan 2026), community members often gather here on Sundays for informal vigils, information sharing, and solidarity, even if a formal march is not scheduled.
  
  **Tips:**
  This is a good location to connect with organizers to find out about mid-week actions or student-led events at UCSD/SDSU.
