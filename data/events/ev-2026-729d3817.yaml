description: |
  A full-day forum organizing resistance against oppression, with a major focus on solidarity with the Iranian people's uprising ('Woman, Life, Freedom'). The event features seminars, panel discussions, workshops, art exhibitions, and book tables. It is an independent, leftist, and grassroots initiative explicitly separate from MEK/monarchist groups.
  
  **Tips:**
  This is an indoor forum/festival format rather than a street march. Entrance is free, but tickets for the evening party (dinner/music until 23:00) cost ~100 SEK. Expect a mix of Swedish and Farsi speakers.
