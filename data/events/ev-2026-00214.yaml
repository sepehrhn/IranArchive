title: "Berlin Central Demonstration (Warning: MEK Affiliated)"

featured: false

description: |
  A major demonstration is taking place in Berlin this Saturday. **NOTE:** The primary organizers are affiliated with the NCRI/MEK (the group you excluded). However, independent diaspora members sometimes travel to these cities to form separate 'Woman Life Freedom' blocs nearby or hold counter-rallies. Be aware that this is the main reason for the lack of large Frankfurt events.
  
  **Tips:** If you see flyers for a 'Grand Rally' this weekend, they likely refer to this Berlin event.
  
  **Location Details:** Central Mobilization Location
