title: "Saturday Rally for Freedom"

featured: false

description: |
  Weekly gathering point for the diaspora to voice dissent. Given the 'ongoing' nature of the uprising (despite reports of crackdowns), a presence here is standard.
  
  **Tips:** A 'Protest Against UK Digital ID' is also scheduled for Hyde Park Corner on this day; do not confuse the two crowds if moving between locations. If no large crowd is visible here, head to the Embassy.
  
  **Location Details:** North Terrace (often shared with other causes, check specific spot)
