description: |
  A community-led demonstration in solidarity with the nationwide uprising in Iran (Dec 2025–present). Participants will gather to condemn the regime's brutal crackdown, mass executions, and internet blackouts. Expect chanting of slogans such as 'Woman, Life, Freedom' and demands for the UK government to proscribe the IRGC.
  
  **Tips:**
  Dress warmly for January weather. Bring signs and Iranian flags (Lion and Sun or plain tricolor). Be aware that various opposition factions often attend these large rallies; this event is independent of MEK/NCRI.
