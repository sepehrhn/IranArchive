description: |
  Ottawa's Iranian community has held recurring rallies on Sundays to support the revolution. Participants often gather to chant slogans, wave the Lion and Sun flag, and demand the listing of the IRGC as a terrorist entity.
  
  **Tips:**
  Winterlude is active nearby; expect crowds. Parliament Hill can be very windy/cold, so dress in layers. Check 'Ottawa Rise IRAN' social channels for last-minute cancellations due to weather.
