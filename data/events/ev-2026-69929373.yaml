title: "Weekly Solidarity Demonstration"

featured: false

description: |
  Weekly recurring rally by the non-affiliated Iranian diaspora and 'Woman Life Freedom' supporters. Given the ongoing heavy crackdown and the recent UN session, a gathering is highly expected here. These protests typically feature the 'Lion and Sun' flag and chanting.
  
  **Tips:**
  Dress warmly (sub-zero forecast). Double-check 'Kvinna Liv Frihet Stockholm' social media pages for last-minute time changes. Note: If no large crowd is visible here, check Odenplan or travel to the Forum in Husby.
