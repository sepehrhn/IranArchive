title: "International Rally for Iran - 40th Day of Mourning"

featured: false

description: |
  A major demonstration called for by exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi and local activists to mark 40 days since the regime's brutal crackdown began. Demands include the release of political prisoners, an end to executions, and the severing of economic lifelines to the regime. Activists are calling for non-Iranian allies to join this 'massive' show of solidarity.
  
  **Tips:** This is expected to be a large crowd. Dress warmly for the waterfront wind. 'Lion and Sun' flags will be prominent.
  
  **Location Details:** Near the Olympic Cauldron; waterfront area.
