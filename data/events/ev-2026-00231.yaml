title: "Global Day of Action for Iran (Atlanta)"

featured: true

description: |
  Solidarity rally supporting the 'Lion and Sun' revolution and the 'Global Day of Action' called by Reza Pahlavi. Protesters will likely demand the designation of the IRGC as a terrorist organization and support for the uprising.
  
  **Tips:** This is a decentralized global action. If no large crowd is immediately visible at CNN Center, check Liberty Plaza across from the Capitol. Bring 'Lion and Sun' flags, not MEK symbols.
  
  **Location Details:** Standard gathering spot: Sidewalks near the CNN Center sign or the park entrance facing Marietta St NW.
