featured: false

description: |
  A rally to echo the voices of compatriots in Iran and demand action from U.S. policymakers regarding the ongoing crackdown. The event will begin with speeches at the memorial followed by a march to the White House. The organizers advocate for the recognition of Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi and a secular democratic Iran. | Tips: The group emphasizes the use of the 'Lion and Sun' flag. Wear comfortable shoes for the march to the White House (approx. 5-10 min walk). Expect heightened emotions given the recent 'January Massacre' reports.
