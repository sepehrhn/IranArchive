description: |
  Larger regional demonstrations often consolidate in Malmö. Given the severity of the Jan 2026 crackdowns, a rally here is highly likely if no specific event is held in Lund.
  
  **Tips:**
  Take the Öresundståg or Pågatåg to Malmö C; the square is a short walk across the bridge. Check 'Kvinna Liv Frihet Malmö' social channels.
