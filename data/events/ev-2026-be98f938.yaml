  While no official press release exists for this specific weekend, local activists (including the group that organized the Jan 14 Vismarkt protest) often hold smaller, recurring stands or spontaneous gatherings on weekends during crackdown periods. Look for the 'Lion and Sun' flags or 'Woman, Life, Freedom' banners.
  
  **Tips:**
  Check local Instagram pages of Iranian student associations in Groningen or look for groups gathering around 14:00-16:00.
