  A continuation of the weekly mass demonstrations in solidarity with the nationwide uprising in Iran. Protesters are demanding the fall of the Islamic Republic, the designation of the IRGC as a terrorist organization, and support for the Iranian people's strikes and protests. Expect chanting, singing of revolutionary songs, and speeches from community activists.
  
  **Tips:** Dress warmly for the weather. Bring Iranian flags (Lion and Sun preferred by many) and signs. This location was the site of the 'massive' rally on Jan 25.
