description: |
  Spontaneous or short-notice rallies are common at Place de la République on Saturday afternoons during this uprising period. While no specific 'Mega-Rally' call was found for this specific Saturday in the search results (unlike the major Jan 17/18 demos), local activists often gather here to condemn the recent executions.
  
  **Tips:**
  Check the Instagram pages of 'Femme Vie Liberté Paris' or 'Queer Iran Paris' on Saturday morning for last-minute confirmations. NOTE: A separate Palestine solidarity march is also planned for Saturday at 14:00 in Paris; ensure you locate the specific Iran group.
