title: "Recurring Saturday Solidarity Gathering"

featured: false

description: |
  Likely informal gathering to support the Iranian uprising. In the absence of a specific call-out, local activists often maintain a presence here on Saturdays during peak unrest.
  
  **Tips:**
  This is a 'likely' event based on recurring patterns rather than a fresh press release. Bring warm clothes and prepared signs. If the square is empty, check Gustav Adolfs Torg in Malmö.
