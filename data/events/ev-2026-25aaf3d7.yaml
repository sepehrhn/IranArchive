title: "Woman, Life, Freedom (Zan, Zendegi, Azadi) Exhibition Opening"

featured: false

description: |
  Opening day of a major solidarity exhibition serving as a 'creative response' to the current uprising. Features works by local Iranian diaspora artists and allies specifically creating art as a form of protest against the regime's oppression. While not a street march, this is a designated gathering space for supporters.
  
  **Tips:**
  The exhibition runs through Feb 25, but the opening day (Sunday) often draws community members. A formal performance is scheduled for later in the month (Feb 10), but Sunday is the first viewing opportunity.
