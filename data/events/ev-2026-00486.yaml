description: |
  Sundays have been a common day for major rallies in Dublin during this uprising (e.g., Jan 11, Feb 1). Focus is on condemning the recent mass executions and internet blackouts. | Tips: Crowds have been gathering at the Spire. Look for the 'Lion and Sun' flags which distinguish opposition groups from pro-regime elements.
