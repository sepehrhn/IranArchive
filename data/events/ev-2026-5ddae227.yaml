description: |
  A broader community gathering to 'reflect on the current moment' and discuss actions for 2026. While not exclusively for Iran, this event includes 'solidarity' themes and may serve as a meeting point for activists before heading to downtown protests. It focuses on local and international resistance.
  
  **Tips:**
