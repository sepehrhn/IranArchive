title: "Weekly Solidarity Rally for Iran Uprising"

featured: true

description: |
  A recurring community rally to support the ongoing uprising in Iran, condemn the recent wave of executions and mass detentions, and call for the Australian government to take stronger action (such as listing the IRGC as a terrorist entity). Attendees typically chant slogans like 'Woman, Life, Freedom' and 'Zan, Zendegi, Azadi'.
  
  **Tips:** This event is rated 'Likely' based on the regular Sunday schedule of these rallies. However, double-check specific times as the 'Mardi Gras Street Rally' is also scheduled for this Sunday in the CBD, which might affect the exact meeting spot or time. Wear comfortable shoes and bring water.
  
  **Location Details:** 483 George St, Sydney NSW 2000 (Gadigal Country). Look for the 'Woman, Life, Freedom' banners near the steps or square.
