title: "Woman Life Freedom Gathering"

featured: false

description: |
  Piccadilly Gardens is frequently used for spontaneous or student-led gatherings supporting the 'Woman, Life, Freedom' movement. While the main static rally often occurs at St Peter's Square, marches often start or end here.
  
  **Tips:** This location is often busier with general public foot traffic. Look for the Iranian tricolour flags.
  
  **Location Details:** By the Queen Victoria statue or the concrete pavilion.
