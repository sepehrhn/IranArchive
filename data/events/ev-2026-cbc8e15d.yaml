title: "Free Iran - Stop Executions & Solidarity with the Uprising"

featured: false

description: |
  A major weekly rally in solidarity with the nationwide uprising in Iran (began Dec 2025). Participants are protesting the brutal crackdown, mass arrests, and recent surge in executions. Recent reports (Jan 24) indicate these Saturday rallies have been consolidating the opposition under the banner of the 'Woman, Life, Freedom' movement and supporters of a secular democratic transition (often associated with Reza Pahlavi's call for unity).
