title: "Woman Life Freedom Gathering"
featured: false

description: |
  The Association, which just received the Clara Campoamor award, frequently holds Saturday rallies at Callao to support the 'Woman, Life, Freedom' movement. Given the new wave of university protests in Iran this week, a gathering here is highly probable. | Tips: This location typically hosts the grassroots, non-monarchist diaspora and Spanish feminist supporters. Look for 'Mujer, Vida, Libertad' signs.
