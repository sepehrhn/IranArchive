  While no official event is scheduled for this specific date, spontaneous gatherings often occur at Malieveld or near the Iranian Embassy on Saturdays during peak uprising periods. Note that a major formal protest was recently banned at the embassy location.
  
  **Tips:**
  Police presence may be heightened near the Embassy due to the recent ban on the Jan 23 Amnesty protest. Malieveld is the standard authorized protest zone.
