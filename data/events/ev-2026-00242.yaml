title: "Global Day of Action: Solidarity with Iran Uprising"

featured: true

description: |
  A major rally coinciding with worldwide protests designated as a 'Global Day of Action'. Protesters are demanding an end to the Islamic Republic, the release of political prisoners detained in the Jan 2026 crackdowns, and are condemning the internet blackouts and mass killings. Expect chanting, speeches, and the display of Lion and Sun flags.
  
  **Tips:** Dress warmly for February weather. This is part of a coordinated global effort, so turnout is expected to be higher than weekly rallies. Check 'Iranian Community of Western Canada' or local 'Woman Life Freedom' social media pages for last-minute time changes, but 2:00 PM is the standard start time for these events.
  
  **Location Details:** 800 Macleod Trail SE, Calgary, AB. Meeting point usually at the Municipal Complex Plaza.
