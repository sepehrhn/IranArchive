title: "Counter-Protest: 'Iranians Stand for Peace & Regime Change'"

featured: false

description: |
  Planned as a counter-presence to the large anti-Herzog/pro-Palestine rallies expected this weekend. Participants aim to highlight that the Islamic Republic's aggression does not represent the Iranian people and to demand the expulsion of the regime's remaining diplomatic staff (following the Ambassador's expulsion in Aug 2025).
  
  **Tips:** Stay close to the main group for safety as tensions between opposing protest factions can be high. Bring water and sun protection.
  
  **Location Details:** Archibald Fountain area, crossing towards Martin Place
