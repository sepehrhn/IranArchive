title: "Weekly Solidarity Rally with the Iranian Uprising"

featured: false

description: |
  Likely continuation of the weekly Sunday marches supporting the uprising. Previous weeks saw thousands march from Panthéon to Place d'Italie (Jan 17) or gather at Trocadéro (Jan 11). These events focus on 'Woman, Life, Freedom' and are independent of the MEK.
  
  **Tips:**
  Confirm exact location on Instagram/Twitter via hashtags #FemmeVieLiberté or #ParisProtest 24h prior. Independent protests are diverse; avoid groups mandating identical yellow/blue vests.
