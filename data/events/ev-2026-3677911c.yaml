description: |
  A recurring weekly demonstration to support the ongoing uprising in Iran. Protesters are demanding the fall of the Islamic Republic, the listing of the IRGC as a terrorist organization, and support for a transitional government (often referencing Reza Pahlavi). Expect chanting, speeches, and the 'Lion and Sun' flags.
  
  **Tips:**
  This is part of a series of weekly Sunday rallies. Dress warmly as it is outdoors. Check the Instagram handle @iranianincalgary for last-minute time confirmations, though 2:00 PM is the standard start time for these Sunday events.
