title: "Weekly Solidarity Rally (Tentative)"

featured: false

description: |
  Following the major rallies on Jan 10 and Jan 16, smaller grassroots gatherings often occur here on Saturdays to protest the recent executions and internet blackouts. Protesters typically demand regime change and chant 'Woman, Life, Freedom'.
  
  **Tips:**
  Exercise caution to identify the organizer. If you see uniformed yellow vests or banners featuring Maryam/Massoud Rajavi, this is an OIAC/MEK event (which you wished to exclude). Independent protests usually carry pre-1979 flags (Lion & Sun), photos of recent victims (e.g., Mahsa Amini, PS752 victims), and do not support the MEK.
