description: |
  A large-scale public art projection featuring works by anonymous international and Iranian artists responding to the regime's repression. While an art installation, it serves as a gathering point for solidarity and visibility for the movement.
  
  **Tips:**
  Visible from the street (Larkin St side). Good location for evening vigils or quiet solidarity after the bridge event.
