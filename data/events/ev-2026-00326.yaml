  Join us for the Global Day of Action in solidarity with the Lion-and-Sun Revolution. Please adhere to the following guidelines for a safe and coordinated event:
  
  1. Please be present at the location exactly at the announced time and refrain from chanting slogans or unfurling flags before the official start of the program.
  2. All participants should gather at the designated assembly point and avoid standing on sidewalks or the edge of the street.
  3. Strictly refrain from burning images of any individuals.
  4. After the conclusion of the program and the police announcement, please leave the location quickly and in an orderly manner.
  5. Due to sensitivities in Turkey, please refrain from bringing Israeli or American flags.
  6. Given the large Muslim population in Turkey, please avoid including the word "Islam" on placards and steer clear of any sensitive topics.
