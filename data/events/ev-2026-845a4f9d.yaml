description: |
  A weekly rally in solidarity with the ongoing nationwide uprising in Iran (began Dec 2025). Protesters are demanding an end to the Islamic Republic, condemning the recent brutal crackdown (Jan 8-9 massacres), and calling for support for Iranian political prisoners. This event is part of a global day of action with simultaneous rallies in cities like Berlin, London, and Toronto.
  
  **Tips:**
  Wear comfortable shoes. Bring Iranian flags (Lion and Sun preferred by many in the diaspora, avoid official regime flags). Signs focusing on 'Woman, Life, Freedom' and condemning the recent mass executions are common.
