  Killed on the street in Tehran. The tweet was posted on Dec 26, 2025, and the protest began Dec 28, 2025. The date of death is inferred to be on or after the protest start date, but the specific date is not provided. The tweet mentions 'Thursday night' which, given the tweet date, would be Dec 26, 2025.
