  Persian Name: امیرحسین شاکرمی

  Shot directly with live ammunition by government forces on his first night in the streets. He was shot at close range (less than 10 meters), with the bullet entering his chest and side. There were signs of severe beating on his body, indicating he was beaten before being shot. His body was found in a morgue after a long search by his family. His family was denied possession of his body, and a relative secretly transported it for burial. He was buried near the grave of Nika Shakermi, a victim of the 2022 protests.
