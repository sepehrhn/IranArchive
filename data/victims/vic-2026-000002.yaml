description: |-
  During protests on Pirouzi St in Tehran on Thursday, Jan 8, 2026, a young man named Ahmad Abbasi was killed by live ammunition. 
  Ahmad was originally from Karaj & worked as a theatre actor and writer in Tehran. The Abbasi family has reportedly been required 
  to pay $3,500, a so-called "bullet fee" to proceed with their son's burial, which they have been unable to pay so far.


  Shot in Piroozi Street, managed to reach an alley before dying. His mother held his body overnight in the alley due to security situation and lack of ambulances. Security forces later took the body. The family is reportedly asked for 1 billion Toman for the 'bullet fee' to receive the body.
