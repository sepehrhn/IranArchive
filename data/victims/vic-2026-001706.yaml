  Persian Name: حسین طلافروش

  Died during protests. The name 'Talafroosh' might be a descriptor (goldsmith) rather than a surname, or it could be his surname. The text mentions 'حسین طلافروش بود' which could mean 'Hossein was a goldsmith' or 'Hossein Talafroosh was'. Given the previous entry for Hossein Jozegian, this might be a duplicate or a clarification.
