  Arrested during protests in Dey 1404 (January 2026). Died in prison a few days after arrest. Evidence suggests he was shot at close range ('tir-e khales'). His body was returned to his family.

  Doctor who left his home on January 8, 2026 at around 18:45 to participate in nationwide protests in Sari. Disappeared for six days while family searched hospitals, police stations, detention centers, and morgues. Authorities gave contradictory responses saying he was 'fine', 'detained', 'forbidden from visits' but never revealed his location. After six days, family was called to identify his body at the coroner's office. Examination showed a bullet had hit his side area. Circumstances remain unclear whether he was shot and killed on the street the same day, or was wounded and transferred by security forces and died from bleeding without medical care, or was killed during detention.
