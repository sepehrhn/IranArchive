  Killed in Baharestan


  His car was riddled with bullets by military and security forces on the evening of 19 Dey. He died from severe injuries at Al-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan. He was shot around 10:30 PM near Baharestan Square while driving a friend home. He tried to evade a checkpoint, and his car was shot at. The weapon used was unclear, possibly a DShK. His right arm was destroyed, one bullet hit below his heart causing severe lung and liver damage, and another bullet hit his lower back. He bled for about eight hours. Initially taken to a clinic with his friend, they were referred to Al-Zahra Hospital due to their critical condition. His body was returned to his family five days later after they refused to agree to state conditions for its release.
