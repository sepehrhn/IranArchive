  Killed during protests. He posted a video on his page earlier that day speaking in Lori, stating they were going to the streets for Mahsa, Nika, and the people of Iran, and that Iran might be free by 10 PM if they survived. He ended the video with the Lori epic poem 'Daye Daye Vaght-e Jangeh' (Mother, Mother, it's time for war).
