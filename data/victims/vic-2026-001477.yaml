  Alireza was a soldier who took leave on Wednesday to not participate in the Islamic Republic's crime. He went to the streets on Thursday and Friday and was killed on Friday by direct shots to the heart. He had been in military service for 5 months and was supposed to get married after his service. His mother had begged him not to go out on Friday, but his mother said that if she didn't go, who would go to the streets. His father went with him to look after him, but only saw his child's death before his eyes. His parents had a child after 20 years.
