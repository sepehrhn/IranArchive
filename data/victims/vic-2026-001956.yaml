  Shot directly by officers from the top of the Imamieh Qasemabad police station. He was pronounced dead before receiving medical treatment. His body was withheld from his family for four days, with authorities demanding the family identify him as a 'Basiji' (volunteer militia member), which they refused. The family also rejected offers from the Martyrs Foundation to recognize him as a 'martyr'.
