  Persian Name: سجاد قنبری

  Killed by a sniper from the Islamic Republic's forces. The shooting was carried out from the top of the Sarmaye Tower. Security agencies pressured the family to claim he was a Basiji, making the handover of his body conditional on accepting this narrative. Family and friends insist he was a protester seeking his rights and had no affiliation with government institutions.
