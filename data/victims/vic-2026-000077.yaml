  Shot by suppressive forces during protests in Poonak street, Tehran.


  Shot directly by security forces in Poanak Street, Tehran. He was originally from Chehriq village in Salmas County, West Azerbaijan Province, and lived in Patavir village, but came to Tehran for work and lived in the city. He was in a very difficult financial situation, worked as an Snapp driver to support his family, and sent part of his income to his family. He was the breadwinner of the family and due to rising rents, he could not even afford to rent a house and slept in his car at night.
