  Shot in neck, shoulder, and lung by security forces while aiding his brother Hamid


  Shot dead by Islamic Republic security forces during the national uprising on Friday night, January 9th. Rushed to help his brother Hamid who had been shot in the head and was shot twice in the neck, leaving him in a coma. Passed away in the hospital on January 17th. One of two entrepreneur brothers and well-known figures in Iran's furniture industry. Father of three young children. Security agencies demanded 1.5 billion tomans from the family to release the body and forced them to sign a pledge declaring the cause of death as a 'stroke.' The family was also required to attend a state-organized march at Enghelab Square as a condition for receiving the body.
