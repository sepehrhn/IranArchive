  The text is a lament from a mother to her son, Mobin Qanbari, who was a street vendor. The mother expresses deep sorrow and regret, wishing she had protected him from freezing to death. The context implies he died from exposure or cold, possibly during the protests. The mother's words suggest he was left out in the cold and she blames herself for not keeping him warm. The quoted tweet refers to him as 'son of Iran and killed on the path of homeland'.
