description: His father held a farewell ceremony for him. The ceremony included playing music in a 'reversed' or 'left-handed' style, which is a sorrowful tradition among the Lurs and Qashqai tribes for bidding farewell to lost loved ones. This style of mourning involves altering the rhythm and melody of celebratory music to a somber tone, and in some very specific traditional cases, physically inverting instruments like the naqareh to signify that 'the wheel of fortune has turned upside down' or 'the world has ended for us'. In Lorestan and Bakhtiari culture, this concept is known as 'Chamari' or the song of death, and can involve covering instruments with black cloth, playing slow and heavy rhythms on the drum, or even smearing mud on the instrument's opening or body. The 'reversed' music is played to signify that the natural order of life has been disrupted by the person's death, transforming joy into sorrow, and to inform the tribe of a tragedy. The deceased's horse is also saddled 'in reverse' (with tack tied backwards) during this 'funeral dance' called 'Kotol' or 'Ketol'.
