  Elina Hejati, 23, was reported shot with live ammunition in Tehran on a Thursday reported as the 18th (date reported inconsistently across posts; early January 2026). She was transferred urgently to Shohada-ye Tajrish Hospital.

  Reports state that hospital personnel expelled her family from the hospital, and the next morning the family was informed that she had died due to severe bleeding.

  Three days later, the family reportedly found Elina’s body in Kahrizak.
