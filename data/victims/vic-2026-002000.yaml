  Killed on the path of the homeland. The tweet also mentions 'Javid Name' which means 'immortal' or 'martyr'. The date is inferred from the hashtag 'Javidnam1404' which likely refers to Dey 1404 (December 2025 - January 2026), and given the protest start date of December 28, 2025, the earliest possible date for a victim in Dey 1404 is December 29, 2025.
