  Arash Nikhoo is a teacher and environmental activist in Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad province, known for organizing and participating in grassroots efforts to protect the Zagros forests and respond to wildfires through the volunteer group “Yegan Siyavash.”

  He was reported arrested by Iranian security forces in late Dey 1404 (mid–late January 2026). Reporting differs on the precise arrest location (Dehdasht vs. Yasuj) and the exact day cited across posts and coverage; IranWire and human-rights reporting state that since his arrest, no official information has been provided about his place of detention, the detaining authority, or any charges.

  **Last seen / disappearance date used above (per IranArchive missing-person convention):** 2026/01/19 (reported as 29 Dey 1404; marked *Approximate* due to conflicting date/location reporting).
