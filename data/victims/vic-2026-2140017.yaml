description: 30-year-old electrical engineer and resident of Qeshm Island who was shot from behind by government forces during suppression of popular protests. He was an ordinary citizen with a simple and peaceful life who enjoyed mountaineering, ran a shop in Qeshm, and was known by friends as a kind, humanitarian person who loved animals, especially cats. He was unmarried and had a bright future ahead. Local witnesses say he was directly targeted from behind on January 8th without being armed or posing any danger to anyone, demonstrating deliberate use of lethal violence against unarmed citizens.
