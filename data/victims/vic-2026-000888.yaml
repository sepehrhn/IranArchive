description: |
  Mohammad Erfan Faraji (18) was killed by gunfire during protests in south Tehran, in the Naziabad area around Behesht Square.
  
  According to reports, he was recording the protests when he was shot from behind at close range at around 8:00 p.m. on 2026/01/08. The bullet reportedly passed through his heart and exited his chest. Bystanders carried him to a nearby home, and he was later taken to Amir al-Momenin Hospital, where the family was informed he had died instantly.
  
  Erfan was a resident of Shahr-e Rey. His family had been preparing a surprise party for his 18th birthday that night (two days after his actual birthday). After his death, the family reportedly faced intense pressure and restrictions on mourning ceremonies, and his burial was carried out under heavy security at Behesht-e Zahra cemetery.
