  Persian Name: یاسین جاویدان

  Killed by direct live ammunition to the chest, head, and neck after the Gas Square Basij base was taken over. His family was pressured to sign a document stating he was a Basiji, but during his funeral, family and attendees chanted 'Javid Shah' and 'We swear by the blood of our companions'. He used to joke, 'After the revolution, I'm the only member of the Immortal Guard whose surname is also immortal.'
