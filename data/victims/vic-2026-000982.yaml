  44-year-old taxi driver and father of three children (ages 4, 11, and 15), originally from Kangavar but living in Vahidiyeh Shahriar for years. He was alone in the Vahidiyeh area on Joqin Street when he was trapped by Basij forces and plainclothes agents.

He was a relative of Erfan Khazaei, who was killed in the 2022 revolutionary uprising.
