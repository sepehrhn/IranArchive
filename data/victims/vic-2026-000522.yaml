  Shot and killed with live ammunition from an AK-47 fired directly by Islamic Republic security forces on Kashan Street in the Elahiyeh neighborhood. Died on the spot.


  Shot and killed on the evening of Thursday, January 8th, on Kashan Street in the Elahiyeh neighborhood. He was targeted with live ammunition loaded in an AK-47, fired directly by the Islamic Republic security forces, and died on the spot. After killing the teenager, the forces seized his body and later handed it over to the family in exchange for one billion tomans. The family was previously pressured to list the cause of death as 'fall from height' but refused, yet the death certificate was issued with that claim.
