  Shot from behind with a war bullet while moving away from the scene during protests in Fooladshahr. Suppressive forces fired extensively and directly at him. An unknown person who knew Younes transported his wounded body by car to near his family's home. Family took him to Fooladshahr Hospital thinking he was alive due to bleeding from mouth and nose. Hospital doors were closed and families were denied information. His body was transferred by security institutions the next day. Family underwent a long, ambiguous process with pressure and threats to receive the body after about 10 days, forced to accept specific narratives about how their son was killed. He had just started working as a CNC cutting machine operator one week before his death.
