notes: |
  Amirhesam Khodayarifard (born 19 June 2004) was a protester from Kuhdasht, Lorestan Province, and was killed during the 2025–2026 Iranian protests.

  **Killing (reported sequence)**
  - He was among protesters in Kuhdasht during demonstrations that moved toward Imam Square.
  - Witness accounts and video reports cited by IranWire and Hengaw state he was shot at close range in the head by security forces / a plainclothes agent.
  - He was transferred to medical facilities in Khorramabad and died several hours later from his injuries.

  **Suspected perpetrator (allegation)**
  - IranWire reported local allegations identifying **Ebrahim Aharoun**, described as a retired IRGC member acting in plainclothes, as the shooter (unverified allegation).

  **Disinformation / coercion against family**
  - Government-affiliated media promoted a narrative that he was a Basij member and that he was killed due to “violent actions by protesters.”
  - Reports state officials (including local authorities and IRGC-linked figures) pressured the family and conditioned release of the body / permission for burial on the family publicly stating he was Basij; the family reportedly refused.

  **Identity / community context**
  - Multiple reports describe the family as followers of the **Yarsan** faith (Mirbig clan).

  **Note on inconsistencies**
  - Some reporting describes his age differently (e.g., “22” in one outlet). This profile uses age 21 consistent with the date of birth widely reported.
