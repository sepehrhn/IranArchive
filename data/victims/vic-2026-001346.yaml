# Detailed incident description. Supports basic markdown.
description: |-
  She was a 22-year-old woman and a mathematics-and-applications student at Imam Khomeini International University of Qazvin. 
  Friends and peers describe her as a high-achieving student—an Olympiad participant—and a committed member of the academic community 
  who served as secretary of the department’s mathematics association. 
  According to reports, she was killed on the night of 9 January in Qazvin 
  by security forces of the Islamic Republic during the wider crackdown on protesters. 
  Sources also state that authorities attempted to frame her death as the result of “terrorist attacks” and put her family under pressure. 
  In contrast, people close to her—and content attributed to her personal Telegram channel—describe her as a freedom-seeking young woman 
  with pro-monarchy leanings who went into the streets on days of protest calls, seeking the overthrow of the Islamic Republic.
