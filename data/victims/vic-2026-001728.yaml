  Persian Name: مسعود ستوده‌مهر

  Shot in the head near an underpass on Chaharsad Metri Dezful. He had been suffering from severe kidney failure after contracting COVID-19, had undergone a transplant that was rejected, was undergoing dialysis three times a week, and was awaiting test results for a re-transplant. He had endured pain for four years and had hopes of life, love, travel, nature, and happiness. He owned a pesticide shop and dreamed of having his own greenhouse, getting married, and living a life, but his aspirations were destroyed by a live bullet.
