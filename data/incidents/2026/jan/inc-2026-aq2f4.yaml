narrative: |
  During the nationwide uprising in January 2026, Bushehr witnessed intense protests and a subsequent violent crackdown. On the nights of January 8 and 9, 2026, security forces fired at protesters from elevated positions, resulting in over 20 people specifically sustaining severe eye injuries.
  
  Medical centers in Bushehr were reportedly overwhelmed by the influx of wounded individuals. Among the tragic casualties was Mansoureh Heydari, a nurse at the Social Security Hospital in Bushehr, who was identified as a victim killed in the uprising on January 16, 2026.
  
  Initial reports from a caller on January 13, 2026, had estimated a death toll between 20 and 30, which remains unverified but aligns with the scale of violence reported.
