narrative: |
  Following the nationwide uprising in January 2026, Mashhad became a focal point for severe repression. Reports indicate that security forces used secret detention centers, such as the "Soroush" facility, to hold and torture arrested protesters to extract forced confessions.
  
  Among the victims was 33-year-old Ali Rahbar, who was reportedly executed on January 22, 2026, in Mashhad. While the Iranian judiciary denied this execution, independent sources have corroborated the report.
  
  There were also reports of Iraqi militias being deployed to Mashhad under the guise of religious pilgrimage to assist in suppressing the protests.
