narrative: |
  On January 15, 2026, a Tabriz resident sent a message to Iran International claiming that “martial law” conditions had been imposed in the city.

  The source reported that residents were told they should not be in the streets after 20:00. They also stated that Tabriz’s Grand Bazaar and major grocery/food retailers were fully closed, while some small local shops opened for limited hours. According to the source, access to basic goods (including meat, chicken, and rice) had become difficult.

  The source further claimed that large numbers of military and security forces were deployed across all areas of Tabriz, including smaller neighborhoods far from the city center, stationed on foot and in military buses.

  This incident is currently **not verified** beyond the single-source report and requires corroboration (official notices, additional eyewitnesses, imagery/video, and confirmation of closures and deployments).
