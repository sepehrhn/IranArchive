# Human-readable title of the incident
title: "State media redirects 'Sepehr Baba' video"

# Brief summary (1-2 sentences) for lists and previews
summary: "After VahidOnline published the viral “Sepehr Baba kojayi?” video from Kahrizak, IRIB-affiliated reporting amplified an interview with Sepehr Ebrahimi’s father to dispute/redirect attribution. VahidOnline then released a less-redacted version identifying the father in the viral clip as searching for Sepehr Shokri."

# Detailed narrative of the event. Supports Markdown.
narrative: |
  On 2026/01/23, VahidOnline published a widely shared video commonly referred to as “Sepehr Baba kojayi?” showing families at/near Kahrizak Forensic Medicine Center searching among bodies; a father repeatedly calls for “Sepehr.”

  Because more than one victim reportedly had the first name “Sepehr,” attribution became contested in public discourse. On 2026/01/25, IRIB-affiliated messaging (amplified by Fars News) presented an interview with the family of **Sepehr Ebrahimi** (a different victim named Sepehr) and framed the viral “Sepehr Baba” clip as being used or misrepresented by opposition media—effectively attempting to shift the narrative by leveraging the shared first name.

  On the same date, VahidOnline stated he had published the clip first and explained that an earlier cut had removed identifying audio details. He then released a less-redacted/original version and identified the father in the viral “Sepehr Baba” footage as searching for **Sepehr Shokri**.

  Multiple independent outlets subsequently reported the same distinction: the viral clip’s “Sepehr” is **Sepehr Shokri**, while the IRIB interview shown in response featured **Sepehr Ebrahimi’s** father—two different individuals—documenting a clear attempt at narrative redirection through name conflation.

# Key claims made about the incident (that may or may not be verified yet)
key_claims:
  - "VahidOnline published the viral 'Sepehr Baba kojayi?' footage and later confirmed he was the first publisher."
  - "IRIB-affiliated reporting amplified an interview with Sepehr Ebrahimi’s father in a context used to dispute/redirect the viral 'Sepehr Baba' narrative."
  - "VahidOnline later released a less-redacted/original version identifying the father in the viral footage as searching for Sepehr Shokri."
  - "Independent reporting corroborated that Sepehr Shokri and Sepehr Ebrahimi are different victims and that the state-media segment leveraged this ambiguity."

# Open questions or missing information
open_questions:
  - "Exact capture date/time of the 'Sepehr Baba' footage (distinct from publication date)."
  - "Original IRIB broadcast details (program name, airtime, and full uncut segment)."

# Limitations of the current report (e.g. lack of video, biased sources)
limitations:
  - "Some primary materials are hosted on social platforms (X/Instagram/Telegram) that may throttle access, change URLs, or remove content."
  - "This report documents narrative manipulation and attribution redirection; the underlying deaths should be documented in linked victim records and relevant incident(s)."
