# Human-readable title of the incident
title: "UV Marking of Protesters’ Apartment Doors Prior to Night Raids"

# Brief summary (1-2 sentences) for lists and previews
summary: "A social media post shares a screenshot of a conversation alleging security forces covertly marked homes (visible only under UV light) to later conduct nighttime raids and arrests."

# Detailed narrative of the event. Supports Markdown.
narrative: |
  An X user shared a screenshot of a private conversation claiming that authorities identified apartments from which residents chanted slogans, then covertly applied a substance (paint/marker) on doors, hallways, entryways, or doormats that was not visible under normal light and could allegedly be seen only with ultraviolet (UV) light.

  The claim states that after several days, security forces reportedly raided these homes late at night and arrested occupants. The person in the screenshot asserts this happened to them and to at least ~10 other people they know of, and urges others who chanted from their homes to check door areas using UV light and remove any marking to avoid arrest.

  At present, the report is based on a single social media post containing a screenshot; no independent corroboration, location details, dates, or direct evidence of markings/raids are provided in the referenced material.
