# Detailed narrative of the event. Supports Markdown.
narrative: |
  During the January 2026 protests, multiple information streams reported a large fire affecting Rasht Bazaar (بازار رشت) and/or the adjacent market area, along with allegations of lethal force used against protesters.

  **Conflicting attribution narratives**
  - State-aligned/Islamic Republic–affiliated reporting framed the fire as arson by “rioters/protesters” and emphasized the destruction of shops.
  - Opposition / human-rights–linked reporting and social media testimony alleged that security forces initiated and/or exploited the fire as a containment method and then shot people attempting to exit the market area.

  **Iran International studio segment (Ali Hossein Ghazizadeh) – added claims**
  In a studio segment published on 1404/10/23 (2026-01-13), Ali Hossein Ghazizadeh described the incident as a major crime beginning Thursday night and continuing into Friday, and stated that a significant disinformation campaign followed showing burned shops as a cover narrative.
  He argued it would be illogical for protesters to burn a large part of the bazaar (private property of participants), and claimed:
  - fire trucks were prevented from entering because the area was surrounded by security forces;
  - the fire was allowed to spread such that protesters faced a forced choice between burning or moving toward security forces;
  - those who escaped were shot;
  - the scale of killings nearly exceeded the capacity of Rasht mortuaries;
  - bodies were left in hospital courtyards, and some families removed bodies without normal procedures due to fear authorities would withhold bodies or erase traces (including fears of “Khavaran-like” secret burials);
  - arrests expanded city-wide and communications were cut, with fears of an execution wave to silence witnesses.
  
  **Status rationale**
  The incident is marked **disputed** because core elements (cause of fire, perimeter control, denial of firefighting access, casualty totals, and systematic concealment) rely on a combination of commentary, witness relays, and unverified social footage without sufficient independent, primary corroboration in this report.

# Key claims made about the incident (that may or may not be verified yet)
key_claims:
  - "A major fire occurred at/near Rasht Bazaar during the January 2026 protests."
  - "Property damage was significant; some narratives cite ~200–300 shops affected (exact figure unverified)."
  - "Attribution is disputed: Islamic Republic–aligned reports blame protesters/rioters; other accounts allege security forces initiated/used the fire tactically."
  - "Iran International commentary alleges security forces surrounded the area and prevented fire trucks from entering."
  - "Iran International commentary alleges the fire was allowed to spread to force crowd movement and that people fleeing were shot."
  - "Iran International commentary alleges casualties were large enough to strain mortuary capacity and that bodies were removed from hospitals without standard documentation due to fear of concealment."
  - "Iran International commentary alleges an ensuing wave of arrests and communications suppression; fears of executions were discussed."
  - "An Instagram-originated video narrative (later amplified on X) alleges a similar trap-and-shoot pattern at bazaar exits."

# Open questions or missing information
open_questions:
  - "What is the exact ignition point and timeline of the fire (start time, spread path, extinguishment), and which bazaar sections were affected?"
  - "Is there independently verifiable evidence that fire services were denied access (multiple witnesses, dispatch logs, municipal records, credible contemporaneous video)?"
  - "Are there independently verifiable indicators of perimeter control (unit IDs, vehicle markings, geolocated footage, multi-angle videos)?"
  - "What are confirmed casualty figures linked specifically to this Rasht incident (names, hospital/clinic intake, burial records), distinct from broader nationwide claims?"
  - "What arrests occurred in Rasht immediately after (counts, charges, identities), and is there evidence of subsequent executions tied to this incident?"

# Limitations of the current report (e.g. lack of video, biased sources)
limitations:
  - "The Iran International segment is studio commentary (not a published forensic investigation) and appears to rely on information streams not fully disclosed in the clip."
  - "State-aligned sources and opposition/human-rights–linked sources present conflicting narratives; neither is independently validated here."
  - "The Instagram/X video narrative is not independently verified for date, geolocation, completeness, or provenance."
  - "No confirmed casualty list or independently audited damage assessment is included in this incident file."
