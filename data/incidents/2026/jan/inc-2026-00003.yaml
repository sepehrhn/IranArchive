# Human-readable title of the incident
title: "Rasht Bazaar Fire and Entrapment and Live-Fire Against Protesters"

# Brief summary (1-2 sentences) for lists and previews
summary: "Multiple independent reports converged on a narrative that during protests in Rasht, 
 security forces pursued and encircled protesters in/near the bazaar while fire blocked escape routes, 
 followed by live-fire even as some signaled surrender; a major bazaar fire destroying 300+ shops is confirmed 
 by both state and opposition reporting, while IRIB’s perpetrator framing is recorded as void."

  ### Overview
  During the January 2026 Iranian national uprising and amid a severe communications disruption described by many as a “digital blackout,” the **first widely observed public claim** that **Rasht Bazaar (بازار رشت)** and/or the surrounding market area had burned came from **Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB)** via a national TV report aired on **January 12, 2026**. At the time of drafting this incident file, the report’s central factual assertion—**a large bazaar-area fire**—is not accompanied in this record by independently verifiable public imagery/footage confirming the fire’s origin, start-time, or full spatial footprint; subsequent narratives developed through commentary segments and witness relays rather than direct, independently authenticated on-the-ground documentation.

  This incident is marked **verified** in the IranArchive sense of verification: **multiple independent sources converge on the same core narrative** (fire in/around the bazaar area, pursuit/encirclement, constrained exits, and use of live fire against protesters), while **public primary artifacts remain limited** in this record. Accordingly, **evidence availability is low** even though narrative confidence is high.

  ### State media narrative (IRIB) — property-damage facts retained; perpetrator framing treated as VOID
  On **January 12, 2026**, IRIB aired a report presented by **Mahdi Mahmoudi** describing the event as a **“terrorist fire incident”** in Rasht Bazaar. The segment:
  - asserts that **more than 300 shops burned**, referencing **aerial imagery** and on-site footage;
  - focuses on **shopkeeper interviews** describing severe losses and urging government mitigation (e.g., preventing returned checks);
  - includes remarks from the **governor** promising support and footage of **firefighters still working on-site**.

  In this incident file, IRIB’s **existence-of-fire** and **large-scale damage (300+ shops)** are retained as valid facts because they are **also acknowledged/amplified by opposition/diaspora reporting**. However, IRIB’s **perpetrator attribution and propaganda framing** (e.g., “terrorist,” insinuations about protesters/foreign agents) are explicitly recorded as **VOID** claims: they are not supported by attributable evidence within the segment and are treated as invalid for analytical conclusions.

  A notable editorial feature in the broadcast is an **audible cut** as a firefighter begins discussing the need for **designated places for peaceful protest**, suggesting the segment may have been edited to avoid messages inconsistent with the “terrorism” framing.

  ### Early amplification, suspicion of false-flag arson, and information-environment constraints
  IRIB’s framing circulated widely and was amplified by **state-affiliated outlets (e.g., Tasnim)**. Given the reported blackout, state-media circulation appears to have been one of the earliest ways diaspora audiences became aware of the incident. Online reaction frequently framed the bazaar fire as a **suspected false-flag operation**, arguing that protests in/around bazaars likely involve **shopkeepers** and that protesters would be unlikely to burn a marketplace—an inference recorded here as community reasoning rather than direct proof.

  ### Iran International “exclusive” segment and alleged operational pattern (independent channel)
  On **January 13, 2026**, **Iran International** broadcast a studio segment featuring analyst **Ali Hossein Ghazizadeh**, describing a tactical sequence framed as a major state crime beginning **Thursday night and continuing into Friday**. The account alleges that:
  - security forces **surrounded** the area and **prevented fire trucks** from entering;
  - the fire was **allowed to expand**, forcing protesters into constrained movement corridors;
  - people attempting to escape were **shot**, with killings described as extensive (including claims of **mortuary capacity stress**);
  - a wave of **arrests** and communications suppression followed, with fear of executions to silence witnesses.

  The segment presents this as based on “exclusive information,” but does not clearly explain within the clip how the information was collected or independently verified.

  ### Iran Human Rights (IHR) eyewitness relay — bazaar-area encirclement and shooting despite surrender
  On **January 14, 2026**, **Iran Human Rights (سازمان حقوق بشر ایران)** published a report relaying a **witness account from Rasht**, explicitly tied to the protests of **18–19 Dey**. The witness describes that during chases by security forces, a group of young protesters became **encircled in the bazaar/market area**: **fire** blocked the escape route on one side, and **security forces** held the perimeter on the other. According to the witness, the protesters **raised their hands to signal surrender**, but were nevertheless **fired upon in a burst** and killed.

  This IHR account constitutes an additional independent reporting channel (human-rights reporting + eyewitness quote) that is **directionally consistent** with the “trap-by-fire + shooting” narrative recorded via Iran International and other relays, while still lacking public primary artifacts (geolocated footage; documented victim identities) within this incident record.

  ### Diaspora relay escalation (supplementary, not determinative)
  Following these reports, social media accounts circulated more detailed versions of the same theme. An Instagram account (**the_zhalzzz**) posted a narrated reel citing eyewitness/Javidan Guard relays. Separately, an X thread by **@LiberalAntiLeft** alleged machine-gun-equipped pickups firing into crowds near **Municipality Square (میدان شهرداری)** and asserted extremely high fatalities. These social-media claims are preserved for traceability but are **not used to establish casualty scale**.

  ### Current assessment (why “verified” with low evidence availability)
  The incident remains **partially unresolved** (especially casualty magnitude and hour-level timing), but is marked **verified** because **multiple independent sources converge** on the same core sequence:
  - A large bazaar-area fire with extensive damage (including the widely repeated **300+ shops** figure).
  - Pursuit and/or encirclement dynamics near the bazaar/market area.
  - Constrained exits (including fire blocking routes) followed by **live fire against protesters**, including an eyewitness claim of shooting despite surrender.

  Outstanding verification priorities remain: preserving earliest IRIB copies with metadata, reconstructing chain-of-custody timelines for circulated media, and obtaining auditable corroboration (hospital intake, morgue/burial records, verified victim identities, dispatch logs, and geolocated footage) to confirm casualty magnitude and precisely map the sequence.

key_claims:
  # Verified core narrative
  - "A major fire occurred affecting Rasht Bazaar (بازار رشت) and/or the surrounding market area, resulting in substantial property damage."
  - "More than 300 shops were reported burned/destroyed; this figure is repeated across both state and opposition/diaspora reporting and is treated as confirmed in this incident file."
  - "Multiple independent reports converged on a narrative that security forces pursued/encircled protesters in/near the bazaar area while fire blocked escape routes, and that live-fire was used against protesters during/after the encirclement."

  # Verified-within-source (but not yet auditable here)
  - "Iran Human Rights (IHR) relayed an eyewitness claim that a group of young protesters, trapped between fire and security forces, raised hands to surrender and were nevertheless shot and killed (core sequence aligns with other reporting; individual victim identities are not yet documented in this record)."

open_questions:
  # Timeline reconciliation
  - "What is the most defensible incident time window at hour-level precision? Reconcile: IHR 18–19 Dey framing, Iran International Thursday night–Friday framing, IRIB phrasing such as 'three days after' and 'two nights ago,' and social posts anchoring key moments to 2026/01/10."

  # Casualty documentation (high priority)
  - "What are the confirmed victim identities (names/ages), and do hospital intake or burial records corroborate the reported bazaar-area shooting event?"
  - "Are there independently verifiable indicators of casualty scale (cemetery activity, morgue logs, multiple independent family confirmations) specific to Rasht bazaar/market area?"

  # Firefighting access and perimeter control
  - "Were fire services dispatched, and do dispatch logs, radio traffic, or verified on-scene video show whether access was blocked and by whom?"

  # Perpetrator attribution
  - "Are there credible, independently verifiable indicators of unit presence and actions (vehicles, insignia, CCTV, consistent multi-witness convergence) sufficient to attribute responsibility for ignition and/or live-fire?"

limitations:
  - "This incident is verified based on convergence of multiple independent reports, but public primary artifacts included in this record are limited; evidence availability is therefore low."
  - "Casualty counts cannot be confirmed from this record because no auditable victim list, hospital intake dataset, or burial documentation is attached."
  - "The incident occurred in a degraded information environment (reported digital blackout), limiting contemporaneous verification and increasing uncertainty in hour-level timing."
  - "IRIB is a state broadcaster with strong incentives to frame protesters as 'terrorists'; its perpetrator-attribution claims are recorded as VOID in this incident file, except for the cross-confirmed property-damage facts."
  - "Iran International and IHR reporting include severe claims consistent with each other; however, the record still lacks the primary documentation needed to independently validate casualty magnitude and specific identities."
