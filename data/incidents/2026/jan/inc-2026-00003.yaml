# Detailed narrative of the event. Supports Markdown.
narrative: "**Overview**\n\nDuring the January 2026 Iranian national uprising—and amid significant communications disruption inside Iran—multiple information streams reported a major fire affecting **Rasht Bazaar (بازار رشت)** and the surrounding market area in Rasht, Gilan. The existence of a large fire is broadly reported, but **responsibility for the ignition, the intent behind it, and associated claims of lethal violence** remain **contested**.\n\n**State media narrative (IRIB)**\n\nOn **January 12, 2026**, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (**IRIB**) aired a report presented by **Mahdi Mahmoudi** describing the event as a **“terrorist fire”** in Rasht Bazaar, using language implying protesters are terrorists/foreign agents.  \nThe segment:\n- asserts that **more than 300 shops burned**, including via **aerial imagery**;\n- focuses on **shopkeeper interviews** describing severe losses and urging government mitigation (e.g., preventing returned checks);\n- includes remarks from the **governor** promising support and footage of **firefighters still working on-site**.\n\nA notable editorial feature in the segment is an **audible cut** as a firefighter begins discussing the need for **designated places for peaceful protest**, suggesting the broadcast narrative may have been edited to avoid messages inconsistent with the “terrorism” framing.\n\n**Social media amplification and early diaspora visibility**\n\nThe IRIB framing circulated widely on social media and was amplified by **state-affiliated outlets (e.g., Tasnim)**. Because of the reported **digital blackout**, this state-media circulation appears to have been one of the earliest ways **Iranian diaspora audiences** became aware of the incident. Online reaction frequently framed the bazaar fire as a **false-flag operation**, arguing that protests in/around the bazaar likely involved **shopkeepers themselves** and that burning a marketplace would be counter to their interests. Some users further argued that large-scale marketplace burnings were **not widely reported** earlier in the uprising (since **25 December 2025**), increasing suspicion.\n\n**Iran International “exclusive” segment and alleged operational pattern**\n\nOn **January 13, 2026**, **Iran International** broadcast a segment stating it had obtained **exclusive information**, featuring analyst **Ali Hossein Ghazizadeh**. In this account, the Rasht events are framed as a major state crime beginning **Thursday night and continuing into Friday**, alleging that:\n- security forces **surrounded** the area and **prevented fire trucks** from entering;\n- the fire was **allowed to expand** so protesters faced a forced choice between burning or moving toward security forces;\n- those fleeing were **shot**, with killings described as so extensive that they nearly **exceeded mortuary capacity**;\n- bodies were left at hospitals, and some families pursued **irregular burials** due to fears of concealment;\n- a subsequent wave of **arrests** and communications suppression followed, with warnings of potential executions to silence witnesses.\n\nThe segment does not clearly explain, within the clip, how the “exclusive” information was gathered or independently verified.\n\n**Diaspora eyewitness-style allegations and escalation of claims**\n\nAfter the Iran International segment, social media accounts began citing and “confirming” variations of the same narrative. An Instagram user (**the_zhalzzz**) posted an English-language reel stating the account was relayed by eyewitnesses and individuals described as members of the **“Javidan Guard.”**  \nIn parallel, an X account (**@LiberalAntiLeft**) posted a thread on **January 14, 2026**, claiming to share a report received from a Javidan Guard member. The thread alleges armed, unidentified pickup trucks with machine guns fired into crowds near **Municipality Square (میدان شهرداری)**, that people fled toward bazaar alleys, and that security forces set parts of the bazaar on fire to destroy evidence—asserting extremely high fatalities (1,000–2,000) in one scene. These claims are **unverified** and are recorded here as disputed allegations requiring substantial corroboration.\n\n**Current assessment**\n\nThis incident remains classified as **disputed** due to:\n- conflicting narratives from state media versus opposition/social sources;\n- the absence (in this report file) of independently verifiable primary evidence establishing **who ignited the fire** and whether **firefighting access was blocked**;\n- the lack of a confirmed casualty list or independently audited damage assessment."


# Key claims made about the incident (that may or may not be verified yet)
key_claims:
  - "A large fire occurred in Rasht Bazaar / surrounding market area and destroyed more than 300 shops (state media claim)."
  - "IRIB framed the fire as a 'terrorist' act and implied protesters were foreign agents; interviewees shown did not explicitly identify perpetrators in the aired excerpts."
  - "An audible cut occurs during a firefighter’s remarks about designated places for peaceful protest, suggesting editorial control in the broadcast."
  - "Opposition/diaspora accounts allege the fire was a false-flag operation by security forces."
  - "Iran International’s analyst alleged security forces surrounded the area, blocked fire trucks, used the expanding fire to force crowd movement, and shot people escaping."
  - "Some social media threads allege mass casualties (up to thousands) and arson intended to destroy evidence; these figures are not independently verified."
  - "Claims of widespread arrests and communications suppression in Rasht following the incident were reported by Iran International and echoed by social media users."

# Open questions or missing information
open_questions:
  - "What is the most defensible incident time window (exact night(s) and sequence: Municipality Square crowding, bazaar entry, ignition, shooting)?"
  - "Where exactly did the ignition(s) occur within the bazaar/market complex, and what sections burned (map-level precision)?"
  - "Were fire trucks formally dispatched, and if so, are there logs, radio traffic, or verified eyewitness footage proving denial of entry?"
  - "Are there independently verifiable hospital/morgue indicators (capacity, admissions, burial records) supporting large-casualty claims?"
  - "Can the origin and chain-of-custody of each circulated video be reconstructed (first uploader, time, geolocation cues, edits)?"
  - "Who are the named/identifiable officials or units on scene (police, Basij, IRGC, special units), and what is the evidence basis?"
  - "What is the best estimate of economic damage (insured/uninsured, shop count, affected corridors) from non-state sources?"

# Limitations of the current report (e.g. lack of video, biased sources)
limitations:
  - "Information environment is heavily degraded by reported digital blackout; independent verification is limited."
  - "Primary state sources (IRIB, affiliated outlets) have strong incentives to frame protesters as 'terrorists' and may omit contradictory testimony."
  - "Opposition media and diaspora social media accounts may amplify worst-case claims; sourcing and verification methods are often unspecified."
  - "No independently audited casualty figures are available in this report; all high-fatality claims remain disputed."
  - "Current evidence set is mainly broadcast segments and social posts; additional on-the-ground footage, timestamps, and geolocation are needed."
