summary: "During Jan 2026 protests, a major fire impacted Rasht Bazaar/market area.

# Detailed narrative of the event. Supports Markdown.
narrative: |
  During the January 2026 protests, multiple sources reported a large fire affecting Rasht Bazaar (بازار رشت) and/or the surrounding market area in Rasht, Gilan. Attribution and accompanying violence claims remain disputed.

  **State media narrative (IRIB / Seday-o Sima)**
  In a state-TV style report presented by IRIB reporter Mahdi Mahmoudi, the incident is described as a “terrorist fire” in Rasht market, with language implying protesters are terrorists/foreign agents. The segment asserts that **more than 300 shops** burned, including via aerial imagery, and focuses on interviews with shopkeepers describing severe financial losses and calling for government mitigation (e.g., returned checks). The report includes remarks from the governor promising support and footage of firefighters still extinguishing remaining flames. The segment contains an audible cut while a firefighter begins discussing the need for designated places for peaceful protest.

  **Opposition / human-rights-linked and social narratives**
  - A widely circulated first-person video narrative (originating on Instagram and later amplified on X) alleges security forces intentionally set the fire to trap crowds inside the bazaar and then shot people trying to escape.
  - An Iran International studio segment with analyst Ali Hossein Ghazizadeh frames the Rasht events as a major state crime beginning Thursday night and continuing into Friday, alleging that security forces surrounded the area, blocked fire trucks, forced crowd movement via the spreading fire, and shot people fleeing; it further claims mortuary capacity was strained, bodies were left in hospitals, and families pursued irregular burials due to fear of concealment, followed by arrests and communications suppression.

  **Assessment (why disputed)**
  The incident is classified as **disputed** because:
  - IRIB asserts a “terrorist arson” framing but, within the provided transcript, does not present direct proof of perpetrators and interviewed individuals (shopkeepers, governor, firefighter) do not explicitly attribute the ignition to protesters.
  - Opposition/social claims of deliberate entrapment, denial of firefighting access, and mass shootings are severe but not independently corroborated in this incident file by primary, verifiable evidence (e.g., geolocated/time-bounded multi-angle footage, emergency dispatch logs, confirmed casualty lists).

# Key claims made about the incident (that may or may not be verified yet)
key_claims:
  # Baseline event
  - "A major fire occurred at/near Rasht Bazaar during the January 2026 protests."
  - "Property damage was significant; multiple narratives cite ~300 shops affected (exact number unverified)."

  # IRIB narrative claims (state media framing)
  - "IRIB framed the event as a 'terrorist fire incident' and implied protesters/foreign agents were responsible."
  - "IRIB claimed (including via aerial imagery) that more than 300 shops burned in the Rasht market area."
  - "IRIB interviews focused on shopkeeper losses and requests for state mitigation; interviewees did not (in the provided transcript) explicitly name who set the fire."

  # Opposition/social claims (contested)
  - "An Instagram-originated narrative (later amplified on X) alleges security forces intentionally ignited the fire to trap crowds and shot those fleeing."
  - "Iran International studio commentary alleges security forces surrounded the area, blocked fire trucks, allowed the fire to spread to force crowd movement, and shot escapees."
  - "Iran International studio commentary alleges casualties strained mortuary capacity, bodies remained at hospitals, and some families pursued irregular burials due to fear of concealment."
  - "Iran International studio commentary alleges an ensuing arrest wave and communications suppression, with fears of executions to erase traces."

# Open questions or missing information
open_questions:
  - "Exact incident time window: What are the confirmed start/peak/extinguishment times for the fire, and which bazaar sections were affected?"
  - "Exact broadcast metadata: When did the IRIB segment air (date/time) and is an original link/archive available?"
  - "Evidence of cause/origin: Are there municipal/fire-service records, dispatch logs, or credible contemporaneous footage showing the ignition point?"
  - "Firefighting access: Is there independent corroboration that fire trucks were blocked, and by whom?"
  - "Casualties: Are there confirmed fatalities/injuries linked specifically to this Rasht bazaar/market incident (names, hospital intake, burial records)?"
  - "Perpetrator attribution: Is there verifiable evidence supporting either 'protester arson' or 'security-force tactical arson' claims?"
  - "Arrests/executions: What arrests followed in Rasht, and are any subsequent executions credibly linked to this incident?"

# Limitations of the current report (e.g. lack of video, biased sources)
limitations:
  - "IRIB source material is state media with an explicit narrative frame; the transcript here is user-prepared and the original broadcast link/archive is not yet attached."
  - "The IRIB segment (as transcribed) asserts a perpetrator narrative but does not show direct proof of who set the fire; key parts (e.g., firefighter audio) appear cut."
  - "Iran International segment is studio commentary and does not itself constitute a forensic investigation; underlying documents are not fully disclosed in the clip."
  - "The Instagram/X narrative is not independently verified for date, geolocation, completeness, or provenance."
  - "No independently audited damage assessment or verified casualty list is included in this incident file."
